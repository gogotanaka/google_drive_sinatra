Dubbed a \"splendid temple of drama\" by the local press of the day, its stage was graced by the performances of such notables as Sarah Bernhardt, Clark Gable, Marlene Dietrich, Boris Karloff, and Mae West. More recent luminaries that have performed on this historic stage include Edith Piaf, Sammy Davis, Jr., Annette Bening, Olympia Dukakis, and Jean Stapleton.
