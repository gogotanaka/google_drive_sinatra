On the menu, you will find dishes as ancient as the pyramids to modern interpretations created for His Majesty King Farouq I, the last monarch of Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambiance takes its inspiration from the royal tomb of King Tut. Hand-painted images of Ancient Egyptian artwork grace the dancer\\u2019s stage, main dining room and continue throughout the \\u201cIsis Room\\u201d, our 12 guest private dining room. Our selection of wine and beer is expanding to enhance your experience with the cuisine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Masri also showcases \"Raqs Baladi\" performances (coined in America as \\u201cBelly Dance\\u201d). At Al Masri, we take our dance as seriously as our cuisine. With this philosophy, we have introduced a new approach in respect and appreciation for authentic Raqs Baladi. With great pride, our dancers have earned the respect of San Francisco\\'s academic crowd, performing at events from the opening of the de Young museum to the Legion of Honor\\'s \"Eternal Egypt\" exhibit. In 2006, Al Masri produced \"Dancing on the Nile\", to celebrate the opening of the new building of the DeYoung Museum in the Golden Gate Park. It was preformed mainly by the Sausan Academy of Egyptian Dance graduates. The sold-out production received rave reviews from the Consul General of Egypt. All of our dancers perform exclusively at Al Masri.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Masri is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. With a 75 guest capacity, we are seasoned at delivering unforgettable experiences to parties small and large.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>37.7752856, :lng=>-122.5020859}, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100506", "SpaceId"=>"2742", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}, {"VenueId"=>"10100506", "SpaceId"=>"2743", "SpaceName"=>"Meeting Place", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
