The company's twenty-seven years at Seymour Street are an important part of Vancouver and Canadian theatre history. The tiny 250-seat stage helped launch the careers of Canadian talents such as Michael J. Fox, Bruce Greenwood, Ruth Nichol, Janet Wright, Winston Rekert, Lally Cadeau, and Brent Carver, while introducing Vancouver to works by Canadian playwrights such as Michel Tremblay, David Freedman, and Carol Bolt. Productions by newcomers Sherman Snukal (Talking Dirty), Nicola Cavendish (It's Snowing on Saltspring), Morris Panych (7 Stories), and John Lazarus (The Late Blumer) also premiered there. The original Arts Club Seymour Street Stage was closed for demolition in 1991.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.2721019, :lng=>-123.135189}, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000466/rehearsal-hall.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000466/revue%20hall.jpg"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000466", "SpaceId"=>"1158", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"198", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"The Revue Stage is the Arts Club Theatre’s newest addition to their group of theatre venues.
