Uncover the edible treasure of the tropics with our eclectic Caribbean fare and drinks.\n The Reefâ€™s menus sparkle with the potential of lunch, brunch and dinner plates inspired by the styles and tastes of the Caribbean. Menu selections showcase flavourful West Indian curries , served vegetarian or with a choice of chicken or goat. For dinner, the Kingston quesadilla envelops either jerk chicken or tofu, peppers, melty cheddar, and refried beans, and the coco prawns roll around in toasted coconut before putting on a cool minted avocado yoghurt ski-bunny costume.\n \n Vibrant colours, tropical plants, and kitschy signs bring you back to days spent skipping geometry in Caribbean boarding school, creating a casual, fun atmosphere for patron inhalation. The friendly and personable staff keeps the vibe upbeat, even when jerk seasonings rub off on the back-talking forks and napkins.", "Images"=>"The Reef Van", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000635/The%20Reef%20Van.jpg"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000635", "SpaceId"=>"1722", "SpaceName"=>"", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
