Its signature dish, the world famous Round Tamale, provides comfort to San Franciscans on foggy nights as well as adding to the warmth and festivity of many families' holiday celebrations. The traditional Mexican food draws crowds for lunch, dinner and brunch alike as patrons enjoy everything from enchiladas to chile verde to pozole, all freshly prepared using authentic time-tested recipes. In addition, the menu is infused with modernity by selections such as the Chiva Tamale (stuffed with caramelized butternut squash and yams and goat cheese) or the Tosatada Colorado (layered with our spicy blend of house sauces, tender meat and slaw and topped with a fried egg). The coziness of the dining room provides the perfect backdrop for the comforting food with its historic calendars from years past adorning the walls and colorful pottery perched upon the shelves. This lasting slice of history has been revived with a nod to its cultural significance as well as the excitement and innovation of the modern San Francisco food scene. Come in to relax, convene and take part in what has and continues to make this city extraordinary.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>37.7526416, :lng=>-122.4086191}, :s3_imgs=>[], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100336", "SpaceId"=>"1900", "SpaceName"=>"", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
