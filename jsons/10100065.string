Home to an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and world-class research and education programs, the California Academy of Sciences is one of San Francisco's must-see destinations. From the splashing penguins in African Hall to the wildflowers on the roof, the building is bursting with life. A four-story living rainforest and awe-inspiring coral reef ecosystem will delight visitors of all ages, while immersive planetarium shows will transport audiences through space and time for a new perspective on our planet. Dynamic daily programs - from penguin feedings to coral reef dives - offer a wealth of opportunities to dive deeper. Topped by a 2.5-acre living roof, the Academy is the world's first \"Double Platinum\" museum, recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council for its eco-friendly design and operations. Inside, opportunities abound to meet Academy scientists, share in their discoveries, and join the journey to make our world a greener, more sustainable place to live. In addition to general admission tickets, the Academy offers a variety of opportunities to enhance any visit, including daily Behind-the-Scenes Tours, weekly NightLife events and NightLife VIP Tours (ages 21+) and Penguins and Pajamas sleepovers. The museum is also available for special events of up to 3,000 guests.
