The Company proceeded to purchase enough land to house a four sheet Quonset-type building with four parking spaces. In 1957, the first rock was thrown.\n \n The club thrived for several years while gaining the reputation as one of the most friendly, fun curling rinks in the Valley. In 1981, after 24 years of good service, the “Quonset-hut” was replaced with a new modern facility, which was leased from the Municipality and located beside the hockey arena downtown.", "Images"=>"Entire Venue - wedding table, wedding table II, inside view", "Attachments"=>"GEWC-Approved-FACILITY-RENTAL-RATES- GEWC-Rental-Brochure", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.1950475, :lng=>-122.5652947}, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000243/Entire%20Venue%20-%20wedding-table-2.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000243/entire%20venue%20-%20inside%20view.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000243/entire%20venue%20-%20wedding%20table.jpg"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000243", "SpaceId"=>"560", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"160", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"4000", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"We have a 4000sq/ft licenced lounge/hall that can seat160 people.
