Bouchaine is the oldest continuously operation winery in the Carneros District - a winery that began making wine long before the region earned its reputation for producing the great Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays of Carneros today. the roots of Bouchaine go back to long before Prohibition, when it was first owned by the remarkably-named Mr. Boon Fly, who grew grapes and fruit beginning in the late 1880's. The Property was bought by Johnny Garetto in 1929, and sold in 1951 to Beringer, who used it as a blending and production facility for almost 30 years. It wasn't until Gerret and Tatiana Copeland became the sole proprietors that the winery and vineyards were completely renovated and over 100 acres of estate vineyards were added. Today, Bouchaine creates superior wines that capture the elegance of Burgundy and the exuberance and authenticity of Carneros.", "Images"=>"Bouchaine Vineyards Image", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100056", "SpaceId"=>"669", "SpaceName"=>"Room Name", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
