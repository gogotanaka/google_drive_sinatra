The venue is perfect for large events. The building is handsomely finished yet provides a blank canvas ideal for environment design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Concourse has its own specially designed booth system which can eliminate the need for traditional pipe and drape partitions. The system is installed prior to move-in by our in-house staff and is configured to meet your specific floor plans. Constructed of stylish black metal framing and attractive white canvas walls, each can support 300 pounds and can be fitted with shelving or garment rods for added versatility. This in-house system is a cost effective asset that makes the Concourse extremely functional. The Concourse offers a complete booth package. We can accommodate upto 10,000 guests in our venue.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>43.5758056, :lng=>-85.3100954}, :s3_imgs=>[], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100818", "SpaceId"=>"3294", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}, {"VenueId"=>"10100818", "SpaceId"=>"3295", "SpaceName"=>"The ConCourse", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"7200", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}, {"VenueId"=>"10100818", "SpaceId"=>"3296", "SpaceName"=>"Galleria", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
