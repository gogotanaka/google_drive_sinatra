Polished French doors invite you to take your drink of choice outside onto the large wrap-around deck lined with trailing hanging baskets to take in the spectacular vistas.

As the light falls away from the table’s edge, the colours and textures of the oak-laden walls and deeply rich carpeting become indistinguishable. This is a gaming room – and the cards are dealt. Outside in the hallway, golfers pass to and fro on their way to the men’s locker-room, throwing the occasional glance to the darkness but understanding and respecting the players’ need for relative quiet.
