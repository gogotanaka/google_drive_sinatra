There’s a hint of the old country, momentarily transporting you back to the home of your ancestors. Now you begin to understand and appreciate the ambience. For though she is less than seventy years old – a mere child by European standards – Capilano’s clubhouse glows with ageless antiquity.\n \n A classic selection of furnishings is neatly positioned throughout the room, and pale buff walls serve as a backdrop for the substantial collection of paintings by well-known Canadian artists.

As the light falls away from the table’s edge, the colours and textures of the oak-laden walls and deeply rich carpeting become indistinguishable. This is a gaming room – and the cards are dealt. Outside in the hallway, golfers pass to and fro on their way to the men’s locker-room, throwing the occasional glance to the darkness but understanding and respecting the players’ need for relative quiet.
