Permanent exhibitions tell the cityâ€™s stories from the early 1900s to the late 1970s and are complemented by contemporary, groundbreaking feature exhibits.\n \n Since its rebranding in 2009 the MOV has become a leader in the reimagining of museums. Our exhibitions are Vancouver centric and designed to make the viewer think not just about the objects, but their greater context. We've played host to two Venice Biennale in Architecture projects. We've even gone so far as to hire a Curator of Contemporary Issues. We are a bold, contemporary museum.", "Images"=>"Entire Venue - History photo, outside view,", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.2760133, :lng=>-123.1461984}, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000391", "SpaceId"=>"984", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"-"}]}
