Slow Club has seen a handful of talented, award-winning chefs come through its kitchen, and now at the helm is Executive Chef Matthew Paul. With handcrafted cocktails and evolving, seasonal dishes, Slow Club brings a unique energy to the burgeoning San Francisco neighborhood. Behind the scenes, Erin Rooney leads the way for both Slow Club and Serpentine. At just 27 years old, Erin bought Slow Club from Jim Moffat and with no business experience hit the ground running, maintaining the neighborhood charm that has always been present at Slow Club. Slow Club partners with a number of local farms including Prather Ranch, Mariquita and Free Spirit Farms and many more. Through these partnerships, the team at Slow Club has been able to develop a menu that evolves with the seasons and Chef Matthew showcases his talents by incorporating the bounty of California in his dishes. The food at Slow Club is inspired, delicious and varied, while the cocktails include bartender-approved classics as well as innovative twists. The diners at Slow Club are locals and regulars who have been visiting the restaurant since it opened in the early 90's, as well as visitors and travelers.", "Images"=>"Entire Venue - Interior", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>37.7630081, :lng=>-122.4085581}, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10100384/Entire%20Venue%20-%20Exterior%201.png", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10100384/Entire%20Venue%20-%20Interior%201.png"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100384", "SpaceId"=>"2220", "SpaceName"=>"", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
