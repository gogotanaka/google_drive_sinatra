SOUTH OF THE SLOT. It's a little known fact that California winemaking started not in Napa or Sonoma, but right here in San Francisco SOMA, to be exact. At the time, SOMA was called South of the Slot (the slot being the cable car line that ran down Market Street) and it was both a dashing and dastardly place to behold. Home to heroes and scoundrels, artists and working men, familiar to the likes of Isadora Duncan and Jack London, SOMA was the stuff of legend, not to mention the birthplace of great wine. In fact, no less than 120 wineries and commercial cellars called SOMA home. Sadly, the 1906 earthquake ended many of the dreams in this neck of the woods, and whatever spark remained alive was quickly snuffed by the 18th Amendment. Until now, that is. Welcome to Bluxome Street Winery, open in the heart of SOMA from high noon until 7pm Tuesday through Sunday. In the tradition of those that came before us, we're both a working winery and a place to relax and enjoy a drink or two.
