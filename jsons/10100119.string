Parliamo Italiano! E' Tutto Qua means \"It's All Here\" in Italian. It's all about the food here! We travel often to our native Italy to discover the trends in the leading restaurants and research new products in the market. The recipes are our own, but we strive to keep our dishes authentically Italian. The day starts early as pastas are made from scratch, with ravioli being cut and filled by hand. Our bread is baked every 2 hours to ensure the freshness of the contents of the basket on your table. Prime choice meats and fish arrive daily. The Roman style thin crust pizza is made with fresh mozzarella. We make Tiramisu, Panna Cotta and other desserts daily with our just baked cannoli shells being filled right before they come to your table. Only the best quality ingredients are allowed in our kitchens as the owner is a proud member of Slow Food orignated in Italy. The TrueItalian campaign was introduced in North America in 2010. After reviewing our food representatives of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Food presented us with a \"TrueItalian\" window sticker to show we are authentic in our products and preparation. The atmosphere is lively and fun. With a young and energetic staff who love making sure you have a delicious dinner and a good time. Our bartender can mix up a perfect cocktail or introduce you to some of the favorites being served in Rome today.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>37.7977528, :lng=>-122.4062907}, :s3_imgs=>[], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100119", "SpaceId"=>"869", "SpaceName"=>"Balcony", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"30", "Banquet"=>"30", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
