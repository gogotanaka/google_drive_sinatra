Our oversized booths are sure to become coveted tables, while a chef's table, ideal for larger groups, has a view of all the action in the kitchen and below from up above on the mezzanine. Overall, our look is ultra sleek with gleaming white, cool grey, polished black, and lots of pink. Creative martini's, signature cocktails, imported beers including Thailand's Singha, along with a varied and well priced wine list, pair nicely with our menu that is inspired by the flavor and influence from all of the regions in Thailand. Although our atmosphere at Pink Elephant Thai aims to be \"sanook\", that's Thai for fun and vibrant with lots of energy; there's also room to \"sabai sabai\" or relax and chill. With two levels there's enough space to accommodate everyone's mood whether it be for lunch, dinner or late night drinks in a hip, vibrant and energetic room.", "Images"=>"Pink Elephant - outside view", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.286034, :lng=>-123.1251079}, :s3_imgs=>[], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000414", "SpaceId"=>"1052", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"-"}]}
