Just southeast of the steam clock in Gastown, Pourhouse is born of century-old styles of drinking and dining. The 100-year-old building was built in 1910, as home to the leckie boot company – the original structure crafted with douglas fir ceilings, supported by large wood pillars, and brick walls. Pourhouse is furnished in antiques of the era – complimented by custom creations. Every piece in Pourhouse has a story. The cornerstone is the 38 ft. Bar – lovingly handcrafted from 120 year-old planks of reclaimed Douglas Fir. Entrance and hallway walls are finished with era-inspired textures and gold leaf detailing – no aesthetic left unconsidered.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.2840393, :lng=>-123.1083157}, :s3_imgs=>[], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000424", "SpaceId"=>"1077", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"-"}]}
