The sounds of ringing cable car bells recall the nostalgic old San Francisco days. Built in 1913 for the 1915 Pan Pacific Exposition, Hotel Union Square is a visually stimulating fusion of art deco and classic San Francisco style. Beautiful brick walls, original 1915 Egyptian-motif mosaic murals, and sleek furnishings from San Francisco based EQ3, are all complemented by a rich color palate of crimson, shades of grey and earthy taupe.\\r\\n\\r\\nSituated in the heart of San Francisco\\u2019s shopping district and one block from the historic Cable Car Turnaround, Hotel Union Square is neighbors with some of the finest department stores and designer shops around. Aside from the art deco aesthetic, and rich history, this hotel has some of the most unique suites in the city.
