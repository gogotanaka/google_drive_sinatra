The facility boasts polished light maple hardwood floor in the center which can be used for dining or dancing; the elevated stage is right for presentations, a performance or a band, and there's a built-in bar. Rising on all sides are three levels of balconies, where tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte tables provide an excellent vantage for people-watching. With its state-of-the-art lighting system, stage and dance floor, and its versatile seating options, it's especially suitable for corporate galas, creative receptions and cocktail parties. Not surprisingly, the Galleria has been discovered by high tech, multimedia companies and the media, who love the possibilities it offers. They frequently bring in incredible props and produce large-scale audiovisual presentations to launch a new website or product. Other 'transformations'쳌 have included a Casablanca Night and a White Christmas party complete with 'snow.'쳌 While this facility is terrific for high-end corporate and private parties, don't overlook the inventive possibilities for a wedding ceremony or reception.
