The large, bright room feels instantly powerful yet inviting, and it’s no coincidence that these qualities were also embodied by the legendary figure that we take our name from Seraphim “Joe Fortes.\n \n In 1885, this burly seaman landed upon Vancouver’s shores and settled into a cabin in English Bay. There, Joe quickly became one of Vancouver’s most popular citizens, serving Vancouverites in a variety of ways first as a bartender and later as Vancouver’s first official lifeguard. Today, he is remembered by a monument near the site of his home, and his popularity lives on inside the welcoming walls of Joe Fortes Seafood & Chop House.", "Images"=>"joe fortes - Floor plan, Inside view", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.28480099999999, :lng=>-123.1245517}, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000317", "SpaceId"=>"811", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"Joe Fortes downtown Vancouver restaurant welcomes and encourages groups of all sizes.
