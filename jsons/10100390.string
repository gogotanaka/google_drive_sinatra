Of the more than 5,000 ships that supported that epic battle, only she remains as the last unaltered Liberty ship in existence. She was restored in 1979 after a 33 year lay-up in the 'Mothball' Fleet. Then against all odds, the ship and her volunteer crew returned to Normandy in 1994 for the 50th Anniversary of the original D-Day Landings. She received a hero's welcome when she arrived at Portsmouth England and the Normandy beachheads of Utah and Omaha. Thousands of visitors came aboard to meet the crew who made the voyage. The ship is staffed by a volunteer crew and open to visitors 7 days a week from 9-4 pm at Pier 45. The pier is located in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf, where Taylor St meets the bay. If you're riding on the historic 'F' muni car, get off at the large crab sign and walk towards the pier. Adults $12, seniors $8, children $6, children under 6 are free; family of four is $25. Free Audio Speakers throughout the ship. Self-guided tour. Come aboard and feel the vintage 40's vibes of Rosie the Riveter and Wendy the Welder. See her giant steam engine that still works and was filmed in the movie 'Titanic'.
