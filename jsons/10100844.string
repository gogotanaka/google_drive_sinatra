At Credo, we believe in authentic Italian peasant food, simply prepared and served in a uniquely modern environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nComposed entirely of scrap wood, each table is one-of-a-kind, the product of hours of human labor and a keen devotion to sustainable design. The found wood in each table echoes the found ideas you\\u2019ll find on our walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Credo, we believe in nourishing both the body and the mind. Our walls depict the universality of ideas, the clash of conflicting viewpoints and the democratic nature of discussion and debate. From the profound to the absurd, we give equal airtime to all ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredo offers both semi-private and private dining options with tailored menus. Our private downstairs dining room offers a striking convergence of architecture, light and design that echoes the concept of the main dining room. We work hard to ensure complete privacy for corporate meetings and social events.", "Images"=>"Credo - Venue - Interior", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100844", "SpaceId"=>"3372", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
