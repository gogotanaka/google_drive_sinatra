She made a good name for the business and got herself a big following in the community by serving deadly food. However, everyone knows the restaurant business is crazy work, and so after a while she decided it was too much for her. She wanted to spend more time on art, which is her first love. The little restaurant morphed into a store for a short time, but did not prove to be lucrative. Then in 1995, I re-opened the restaurant, made the building bigger, and acquired a liquor licence. Progressively building over the years, the restaurant really started to rock in 2002.", "Images"=>"Entire Venue - Dish , Inside View with Costumers", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.2831033, :lng=>-123.1069357}, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000334", "SpaceId"=>"831", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"La Casita - Gastown is a Mexican food restaurant located in the heart of Vancouver, BC, Canada.
