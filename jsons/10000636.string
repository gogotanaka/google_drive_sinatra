Charcuterie, both made on site and off, cheese, cured and fresh seafood, fresh breads, antipasti are just some of the colourful and delicious offerings available everyday. A listing of daily features from flatbreads, salads, preserves, jams, jellies, and pickled vegetables add a touch of passion to each plate. Though our concept can be misinterpreted by the common diner, The Refinery also offers a selection of hot entrees inspired by some of the timeless classics in modern gastronomy, like braised beef shortribs, gnocc'n cheese, homemade risotto and pastas - our entrees move through seasonal availability as well. Please see our full menu for the current offerings. Additionally, a thoughtful wine list focusing on small lot production and boutique BC wineries, and a selection of well made craft beers from British Columbia on draft and in bottle share the shelves with unique brews from around the world. The food program is maintained and seasonally adjusted by Chef Kirk Morrison and his talented crew.", "Images"=>"The Refinery - Interior", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000636/The%20Refinery%20-%20Interior.jpg"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000636", "SpaceId"=>"1723", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"75", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
