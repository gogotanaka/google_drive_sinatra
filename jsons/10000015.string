The 12 minute Skytrain ride won’t make a big difference to your plans, but the money you save by staying outside of the Downtown core will make a huge difference to your wallet. You can get the best of both worlds at our Accent Inns Burnaby Location. There are a whole lot of other benefits, too. Like free parking. (Try and find that downtown. We’ll wait.) Plus free local calls and wireless Internet. We're also pet friendly, bike friendly and motorcycle friendly. And we have a hot tub, sauna, and fitness room. Although they’re not for your pets. Or your bikes either, for that matter.
