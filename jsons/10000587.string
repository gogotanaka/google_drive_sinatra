The room’s airy, modern design and unique V-shape allow for simultaneous trivial pursuits – guests can crowd the bar watching a game on the 9′ HD screen while around the corner others can be enjoying well-crafted food and drink menus in low booths. The Charles Bar staff are well known to Gastown locals, who make regulars of themselves for the guaranteed good times while DJs round out the venue on weekend nights, dropping everything from classic hip hop to R&B to your favourite Top 40 songs.", "Images"=>"The Charles Bar - Exterior, The Charles Bar - Interior", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000587/The%20Charles%20Bar%20-%20Exterior.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000587/The%20Charles%20Bar%20-%20Interior%201.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000587/The%20Charles%20Bar%20-%20Interior%202.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000587/The%20Charles%20Bar%20-%20Interior%203.jpg", "https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000587/The%20Charles%20Bar%20-%20Interior%204.jpg"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000587", "SpaceId"=>"1605", "SpaceName"=>"", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
