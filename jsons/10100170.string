The H-L House has the distinction of being listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a City Landmark, and selected as a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Having survived the 1906 Earthquake and Fire, the H-L is a remarkable example of post-Gold Rush architecture with its prominent open gables, varied styles of shingles and siding, and a turreted corner tower topped by a \"witch's cap\" roof. Visitors are able to step back in time to experience Victorian life and hear the stories of prominent pioneering immigrants who came to San Francisco in search of opportunity and prosperity, and whose families endure today as the Bay Area's leading civic and cultural philanthropists. Private docent tours can be arranged. The H-L House is also the perfect venue for an intimate wedding, festive holiday party, Downton Abbey costume event, suspenseful murder mystery dinner, Victorian high tea, social gatherings or special events. We can accommodate sit-down dinners for up to 90 people, and standing receptions or cocktail parties for up to 100. We provide recommendations for vendors. The H-L House has been featured on A&E's \"America's Castles,\" the television shows \"Trauma\" and \"Boo at the Zoo,\" and the film, \"American Jerusalem.\"", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>37.7932818, :lng=>-122.4249806}, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100170", "SpaceId"=>"126", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"100", "Banquet"=>"90", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}, {"VenueId"=>"10100170", "SpaceId"=>"127", "SpaceName"=>"Parlors", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"100", "Banquet"=>"50", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"30", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"1000", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}, {"VenueId"=>"10100170", "SpaceId"=>"128", "SpaceName"=>"Ballroom", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"100", "Banquet"=>"90", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"40", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"970", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
