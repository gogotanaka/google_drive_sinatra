V. Macan, a prolific west coast resident golf course architect and built in 1930, underwent a renovation that involved the creation of some new holes, and a driving range and a new clubhouse. That made the original clubhouse, in its location adjacent to the new 17th tee, somewhat redundant. Discussions were held as to what to do with the building which had fallen into disrepair. One suggestion was to turn it into a neighbourhood pub. That didn’t go over well with some local residents.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :s3_imgs=>[], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000066", "SpaceId"=>"154", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
