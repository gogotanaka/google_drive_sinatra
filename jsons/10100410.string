Offerings include original and classic craft cocktails, carefully selected wines, and a great assortment of beer served on tap and individually. The Vestry at The Chapel's full restaurant menu is available when the restaurant is open, with a special late-night menu available after hours. On special nights Chapel Bar hosts live music, and occasionally it becomes part of the ticketed show area, with the venue windows opened to allow a direct view of the music stage while the monitors and speakers broadcast the show.", "Images"=>"", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>37.760565, :lng=>-122.421188}, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100410", "SpaceId"=>"386", "SpaceName"=>"Room Name", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
