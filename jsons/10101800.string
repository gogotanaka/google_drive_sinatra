Their collaborative genius created the inspirational hotel that\\'s definitely hip: Hotel Triton, a 140-room wonderland like no other.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by the original creators\\' imagination, our San Francisco boutique hotel continues to evolve, always staying at the forefront of all things visionary and distinct. Step inside our lobby and check out a fantastic mural that tells the story of San Francisco\\'s growing and ever-changing art scene. Discover stunning photos in the hallways instead of uninspiring art you\\'ve learned to tune out. We\\'ve even designed a collection of celebrity hotel suites, joining forces with some of the most dynamic names in the entertainment industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hotel Triton, a Kimpton Hotel, is also an inspiration and pioneer in environmentally friendly: Our entire Union Square hotel is cleaned with \"green\" products, our eco-friendly rooms and eco-celebrity suites are hugely popular, and we\\'ve partnered up with The Trust for Public Land, donating a percentage of room revenue to this visionary organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest of all, just two blocks from Union Square, Hotel Triton is right in the center of the scene that drives San Francisco. Across the street from the Chinatown gates, our boutique hotel is conveniently located five blocks from Moscone Center. Hotel Triton is just a short walk to Little Italy, a quick complimentary towncar ride Monday through Friday 7-9 a.m. to the Financial District, or a smooth stroll to historic Nob Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s no wonder Harper\\'s Bazaar singled out the Hotel Triton as the best hotel in San Francisco, calling it \"a happening and unique escape from the mundane.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnique meeting room with private patio can accomodate up to 20 people.
