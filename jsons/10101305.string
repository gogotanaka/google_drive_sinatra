We are a neighborhood tavern specializing in craft beer, while offering upscale pub food and an excellent wine list. For beer selection, we have 24 draughts and over 150 bottles on our everyday list; on our vintage list we have about 15 select and rare bottles from our cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe seek a balance of styles and profiles on the draught list, and we do our best to represent most styles with the bottle offerings. About a third of the list is Belgian, and there is a concentration of Californian breweries on the draught list. The vintage list seeks to strike a balance of style, bottle size, and year. As the seasons change, so does the emphasis of styles for draught, bottle and vintage.", "Images"=>"Monk's Kettle - Interior", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10101305", "SpaceId"=>"4452", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
