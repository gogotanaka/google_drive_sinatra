Spectacular living exhibits explore the diverse habitats of one of the world's richest marine regions, and well beyond too. The newly renovated, two-story Sea Otter exhibit showcases the antics of the smallest of all marine mammals. \"The Jellies Experience\" is the newest special exhibition that takes visitors on a mind-bending journey into the world of these dancing, pulsing, beautiful creatures. The three-story living kelp forest is unique and awe-inspiring, recreating the underwater forest that lies just beyond the Aquarium's decks. The million-gallon Open Sea puts you eye-to-eye with sharks, sea turtles, tunas, ocean sunfish and a vast sardine school. The \"Splash Zone\" galleries are made especially for kids and families, with penguins and eels, tropical fish, and an ocean of hands-on experiences. Also new is a renovated restaurant. \"Cindy's Waterfront\" and the adjoining casual cafe both offer a farm-to-table dining experience created by Cindy Pawlcyn. Guests looking to go even deeper can choose from an array of Aquarium Adventures. Behind-the-scenes tours, \"morning rounds,\" family sleepovers, summer SCUBA experiences for kids 8 to 13 years old. All exhibits, activities and events other than Aquarium Adventures are included with admission.", "Images"=>"monterey bay aquarium image", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>false, :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10100277", "SpaceId"=>"1636", "SpaceName"=>"", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"2500", "Banquet"=>"200", "Theater"=>"268", "Classroom"=>"80", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
