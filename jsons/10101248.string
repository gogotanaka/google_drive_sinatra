And not by accident. Marin County is just a little out there. As in, one famous bridge away from San Francisco. And right next door to the vineyards of Napa and Sonoma. Closer than you could ever imagine to everything that\\u2019s unique in this clever corner of California. There\\u2019s hang gliding and kayaking. Fresh, sustainable agriculture. The pinnacle of luxury and the world\\u2019s finest wines. All here in this special place. The home of holistic artists and goat cheese artisans. The birthplace of mountain biking and Obi Wan Kenobi. The natural habitat of those grateful for nature and of the Grateful Dead.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you hold an event, you want it to be remarkable.
