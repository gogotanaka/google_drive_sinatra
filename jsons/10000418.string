We support new plays from creation to performance. On the page and in the studio, our playwrights are creating a new vision of Canadian theatre. By supporting in-depth development for independent voices, we foster theatre’s role in building a society that values critical conversations about how we choose to live our lives. Our work is guided by the values of leadership, excellence, diversity, and creative transparency.\n \n Each dramaturgical partnership between writer and dramaturg is unique, and may include research, script analysis, and physical creation. PTC assists its writers in designing their own dramaturgical processes, while offering expertise in a wide range of approaches, from traditional drama to site-specific creation, audio walking-plays to image-based physical work.", "Images"=>"Entire Venue - pic 1", "Attachments"=>"", :latlng=>{:lat=>49.2698765, :lng=>-123.1350424}, :s3_imgs=>["https://venuedb.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/10000418/Entire%20Venue%20-%20pic%201.jpg"], :spaces=>[{"VenueId"=>"10000418", "SpaceId"=>"1057", "SpaceName"=>"Entire Venue", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>"-"}, {"VenueId"=>"10000418", "SpaceId"=>"1058", "SpaceName"=>"Hub Rental", "SpaceDescription"=>"", "Reception"=>"", "Banquet"=>"", "Theater"=>"", "Classroom"=>"", "Boardroom"=>"", "Size"=>"", "Height"=>"", "Privacy"=>"", ">>>HIDDEN>>>"=>"", "MSpaceDescription"=>""}]}
