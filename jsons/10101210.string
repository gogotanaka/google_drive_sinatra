Light and airy and more subdued in the morning and afternoon, Level III offers an ideal spot for a meeting over coffee, to cozy up in a quiet corner, or to enjoy a delicious meal with friends. In the evenings when the lights go down, the music turns up-tempo and the bar opens up to showcase the talents of the bartenders mixing hand-crafted cocktails, the restaurant and lounge is magically transformed into a vibrant and energetic gathering place that is bound to become a favorite hot spot for locals and visitors alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel III offers a unique experience for every diner.
